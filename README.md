# Student Enrollment Form

## Overview

The Student Enrollment Form is a web application that allows users to manage student records. The form enables users to enter new student information or update existing records based on a unique Student ID. The application interacts with a backend database to store and retrieve student data.

## Features

- **Add New Student**: Allows users to enter details for a new student if the Student ID does not already exist.
- **Update Existing Student**: Enables users to update the information of an existing student using their Student ID.
- **Reset Form**: Clears the form fields and disables the Save and Change buttons.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before saving or updating data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the form.
- **JavaScript**: Form validation, data handling, and AJAX requests.
- **Bootstrap**: Styling and responsive design.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
- **JSON-PDB**: Database interaction for CRUD operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student-enrollment-form
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the form.

## Usage
